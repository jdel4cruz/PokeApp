- Need to pull hyphens out of pokemon ability names for AllAbilities route.
- Eventually will add loading triggers and some form of loading transition for the routes so things don't just phase into existance
- Will eventually re-evaluate what states need to actually be states. A lot of data that I current store in states are static so they could simply be assigned to a const instead. List of potential states to be changed listed below
	- PokemonDescription:
		- Just about everything tbh. There's no user input really available that would change the data in the components and require a re-render
	- PokemonEvolutions:
		- Same as above
	- PokemonMoves: 
		- Same as above
	- PokemonGrid/ItemGrid
		- The raw data and raw cards that are generated from the raw data are static. These could be set to consts, leaving cards as the only state that needs to be present as it will change based on searchTerm/filterSort
- Media Queries need to be generated to accomodate for different screen sizes. Currently when scaled down it looks terrible.
	- Lists for PokemonMoves fail at ~600px. I can't really think of a way to keep the current component layout and have it still be readable. I either leave it as is for now or come up with a new design at smaller screen sizes

- Refactor based on Michael's feedback and potentially refactor PokemonMoves route to use the components in AllMoves (may be difficult as they receive data in different forms)
- Should create an error page if something explodes.
