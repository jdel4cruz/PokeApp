- Some data pulled from the API contains hyphens/underscores for spaces and does not capitalize the 1st letter of words. Create a function to replace hyphens/underscores with spaces and use text-transform to get proper capitalization
- Filter on pokemon grid isn't fixed or sticky and disappears as you scroll down. Needs to be fixed
- Eventually will add loading triggers and some form of loading transition for the routes so things don't just phase into existance
- Ignoring styling right now until all components/routes are ironed out. 
- Am considering putting off search functionality until styling is done.
